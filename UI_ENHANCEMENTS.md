### 4. **Features Component** (`src/components/Features.tsx`)

#### Container Animations
- **Staggered Reveal**: Features cards appear with staggered timing
- **Background Glows**: Animated background elements that move in opposite directions
- **Section Badge**: Pulsing badge animation for visual emphasis

#### Card Enhancements

#### Visual Polish
- **Group Hover**: Coordinated hover state for entire card
- **Color-coded Icons**: Each feature has color-matching icon background
- **Stat Values**: Scale animation on hover for better interactivity
- **Border Glows**: Color-specific glow effects for each feature type

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
- **GPU Acceleration**: All animations use `transform` and `opacity` for GPU rendering
- **Will-change**: Strategic use of CSS will-change for frequent animations
- **Backface Visibility**: Hidden to prevent rendering issues
- **Reduced Motion**: All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- **Efficient Transitions**: 300ms default transition for smooth feel without sluggishness

### Bundle Impact
- **CSS**: ~550 additional lines for new animations and utility classes
- **JavaScript**: No additional dependencies, uses Framer Motion (already included)
- **Bundle Size**: Minimal impact - estimated +2-3KB gzipped

## Accessibility Features

### Maintained Standards
- ✅ All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- ✅ Focus states enhanced with cyan outline and offset
- ✅ Keyboard navigation fully supported
- ✅ Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards
- ✅ Loading indicators provide meaningful feedback
- ✅ Skip-to-content link still functional

### Motion Sensitivity
All animations conditionally disable when user has `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` setting

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Features
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
